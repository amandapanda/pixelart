# pixelart
P I X E L  A R T is an experimental, interactive art program where you can paint with existing artwork as your palette. Use the ENTER key to switch between nineteen base artworks, spanning a wide variety of styles. Each artwork will initially be represented by four pixels corresponding in color to the value of the top leftmost pixel of each quadrant; as you move your "brush" (mouse) over each "pixel" it will break into a new set of pixels, further illuminating the currently selected base artwork.




See what art collages and original pieces you can create with the tip of your mouse!
