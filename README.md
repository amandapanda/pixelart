# pixelart
P I X E L  A R T  is an experimental, interactive art program where you can paint using existing artwork as your palette. Press the ENTER key to switch between nineteen base artworks, spanning a wide variety of styles. Each artwork will initially be represented by four pixels corresponding in color to the value of the top leftmost pixel in each quadrant; as you move your "brush" (mouse) over each "pixel" (quadrant) it will break into a new set of pixels, further illuminating the base artwork that is currently selected.

See what art collages and original pieces you can create with the tip of your mouse!
